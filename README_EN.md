# SoloCove

Combining "Solo" (personal, individual) and "Cove" (cove, corner), SoloCove is tailored for niche personal projects, allowing for easy customization without excessive encapsulation.
It's user-friendly and comes with basic routing configurations. Currently, there are two versions available: one with Element-Plus and one with Tdesign-vue-next.
Supports Vue 3 only.
